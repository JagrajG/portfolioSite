            <p>
              ðŸ‘‹ I'm a second-year Computer Science major at Simon Fraser
              University. My passion for programming began in Grade 5 when my
              ICT teacher introduced me to Scratch. From that moment, I knew I
              wanted to pursue a future in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before graduating high school, I made the decision to apply to
              Computer Science programs because I knew it was a field I was
              truly passionate about and would enjoy studying in depth. In my
              first year at SFU, I attended a hackathon where my team and I
              built a full-stack web application from scratch. It was an intense
              24-hour sprint of coding, collaboration, and problem solving, and
              it reminded me exactly why I fell in love with computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I love getting lost in immersive RPG games,
              especially ones with rich storytelling and world-building. I'm
              also a huge sports fanâ€”whether it's watching UFC or NBA matchups,
              hitting the gym for a lifting session, or playing basketball and
              soccer with friendsâ€”I enjoy staying active, competitive, and
              energized.

                <p>
                  During my internship at Savi Finance, I built full-stack
                  features for a Fintech SaaS platform with over 100 active
                  users. I unified React and React Native logic with
                  MongoDB-backed services, reducing release time by 20%. I led
                  the development of an inline account editing tool using Redux,
                  cut image load failures by 20% with an AWS S3 image upload
                  system, and improved login success rates by 45% through UI and
                  validation enhancements.
